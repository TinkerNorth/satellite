// Reorder window for one direction of one controller's audio stream
// (MSG_MIC_AUDIO inbound here, MSG_SPEAKER_AUDIO on the client): wrapping u16
// sequence numbers in, in-order packets and explicit gap signals out.
//
// The streams are lossy by contract (docs/contract.md: no acks, no
// retransmits), so `seq` buys exactly two things and no more: it says which
// frames never arrived, so the decoder can conceal them, and it says which
// arrived too late to matter, so they can be dropped instead of spliced in
// behind audio already played.
//
// Deliberately dependency-free -- std only, no types.h. Partly because the
// window is the sort of thing that should be provable on its own, and partly
// because types.h includes THIS (Controller owns one), so the arrow has to
// point this way.
